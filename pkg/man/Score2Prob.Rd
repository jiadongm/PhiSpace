\title{Convert PhiSpace Scores to Probabilities}
\usage{
Score2Prob(PhiSc)
}
\arguments{
\item{PhiSc}{A numeric matrix containing values ranging from -1 to 1.
Rows typically represent cells and columns represent cell types.}
}
\value{
A numeric matrix of the same dimensions as the input, where:
\itemize{
\item All negative values are set to zero
\item Each row sums to 1 (forms a probability distribution)
\item Row and column names are preserved from the input
}
}
\description{
Converts a cell by cell type likelihood matrix to a probability matrix by
setting negative values to zero and normalizing each row to sum to 1.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Sets all negative similarity values to zero
\item Calculates the sum of each row
\item Divides each element in a row by the row sum to create probabilities
\item Handles edge cases where rows sum to zero after removing negatives
}

For rows that contain all negative values (resulting in zero sums after transformation),
the function will issue a warning and set those rows to all zeros. Alternative behavior
could be implemented to assign uniform probabilities.
